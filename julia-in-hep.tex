\abstract{%
Julia is a mature general-purpose programming language, with a large ecosystem
of libraries and more than 10000 third-party packages, which specifically
targets scientific computing. As a language, Julia is as dynamic, interactive,
and accessible as Python with NumPy, but achieves run-time performance on par
with C/C++. In this paper, we describe the state of adoption of Julia in HEP,
where momentum has been gathering over a number of years.

HEP-oriented Julia packages can, via \texttt{UnROOT.jl}, already read HEP's
major file formats, including TTree and RNTuple formats. Interfaces to some of
HEP's major software packages, such as through \texttt{Geant4.jl}, are available
too. Jet reconstruction algorithms in Julia show excellent performance. A number
of full HEP analyses have been performed in Julia.

We show how, as the support for HEP has matured, developments have benefited
from Julia's core design choices, which makes reuse from and integration with
other packages easy. In particular, libraries developed outside HEP for
plotting, statistics, fitting, and scientific machine learning are extremely
useful.

We believe that the powerful combination of flexibility and speed, the wide
selection of scientific programming tools, and support for all modern
programming paradigms and tools, make Julia the ideal choice for a future
language in HEP.}

\subsection{Simulation}

Detector simulation is a crucial component of every High Energy Physics (HEP) experiment, playing a key role both during the design and conception of the detector and later in data analysis. The most widely used toolkit for this purpose is Geant4 \cite{GEANT4:2002zbu}, a C++-based framework with over 2 million lines of code.

Given its complexity and extensive adoption, a complete rewrite of Geant4 in a new language is highly impractical. Instead, this presents an opportunity to explore Julia's interoperability with other languages. One particular challenge arises from Geant4's callback-based user interface, which relies on C++ virtual methods invoked at specific points during particle transport. Application developers must implement these callbacks to configure and control the simulation and extract relevant simulated data. However, integrating this mechanism in Julia is more complex than in other languages, as Julia does not natively support virtual methods.

The Geant4.jl \cite{geant4-jl-github} package has been developed to provide a Julia interface to Geant4. It leverages CxxWrap.jl \cite{cxxwrap-jl-github}, a package that enables calling C++ functions and types from Julia. Similar to Python’s static bindings, invoking C++ code from Julia requires explicit wrapper definitions for each method exposed to Julia. However, given Geant4's large and complex codebase, manually writing and maintaining these wrappers is not a viable approach, especially for making it more sustainable with future toolkit updates. To address this, we use WrapIt \cite{wrapit-github}, a package that automates wrapper generation by utilizing the Clang library to parse C++ header files and extract class declarations. This automation significantly reduces development effort and ensures long-term maintainability of the interface.

Integrating Geant4 with Julia allows researchers to take advantage of Julia's high-level programming capabilities and performance benefits while retaining the full functionality and efficiency of the Geant4 toolkit. This integration also provided an opportunity to rethink and streamline the interface, making it more intuitive and user-friendly. In particular, we focused on ensuring that application developers can concentrate on the essential aspects of their simulations while minimizing configuration overhead. Boilerplate code and C++ idiosyncrasies are hidden, allowing for a cleaner, more concise approach to defining simulations. The performance of the Geant4.jl package is comparable to that of the native C++ Geant4 toolkit, demonstrating the feasibility of using Julia for HEP detector simulation.
