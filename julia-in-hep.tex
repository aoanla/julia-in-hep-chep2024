\abstract{%
Julia is a mature general-purpose programming language, with a large ecosystem
of libraries and more than 10000 third-party packages, which specifically
targets scientific computing. As a language, Julia is as dynamic, interactive,
and accessible as Python with NumPy, but achieves run-time performance on par
with C/C++. In this paper, we describe the state of adoption of Julia in HEP,
where momentum has been gathering over a number of years.

HEP-oriented Julia packages can, via \texttt{UnROOT.jl}, already read HEP's
major file formats, including TTree and RNTuple formats. Interfaces to some of
HEP's major software packages, such as through \texttt{Geant4.jl}, are available
too. Jet reconstruction algorithms in Julia show excellent performance. A number
of full HEP analyses have been performed in Julia.

We show how, as the support for HEP has matured, developments have benefited
from Julia's core design choices, which makes reuse from and integration with
other packages easy. In particular, libraries developed outside HEP for
plotting, statistics, fitting, and scientific machine learning are extremely
useful.

We believe that the powerful combination of flexibility and speed, the wide
selection of scientific programming tools, and support for all modern
programming paradigms and tools, make Julia the ideal choice for a future
language in HEP.}
